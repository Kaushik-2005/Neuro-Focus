Slide 1: Project Overview
- NeuroFocus: Real-Time Attention Detection using EEG Signals
- Integrates EEG brainwave data and eye state for comprehensive analysis
- Detects attention levels continuously and objectively
- Designed for real-time feedback and monitoring
- Applications: education, driver alertness, brain-computer interfaces, research
- Modular and extensible system architecture

Slide 2: Motivation & Problem Statement
- Attention is crucial for learning, safety, and productivity
- Traditional methods (observation, self-report) are subjective and slow
- EEG provides direct, physiological measurement of brain activity
- Need for automated, real-time attention assessment tools
- Goal: Deliver fast, objective, and actionable attention feedback
- Enable new applications in adaptive learning and safety systems

Slide 3: Data & Signal Processing
- Uses EEG signals (brainwaves) and eye state data as inputs
- Focus on Beta (attention), Alpha (relaxation), Theta (drowsiness) waves
- Preprocessing: bandpass filtering, artifact removal, normalization
- Feature extraction: power spectral density, statistical features
- Supports multiple data formats: CSV, EDF, BDF, MATLAB, OpenBCI
- Handles noisy and real-world EEG data robustly

Slide 4: Attention Calculation
- Attention score = Beta/Alpha power ratio (higher = more focused)
- Eye state (open/closed) used to refine and validate attention estimate
- Combines time-domain and frequency-domain features
- Detects and mitigates artifacts (e.g., blinks, muscle noise)
- Real-time calculation for immediate feedback
- Adaptable thresholds for different users and contexts

Slide 5: Model Architectures
- Three neural networks: EEGNet, SimpleCNN, EEGMLP
- EEGNet: advanced, compact CNN designed for EEG signals
- SimpleCNN: fast, lightweight, suitable for edge devices
- EEGMLP: basic multilayer perceptron, good for baseline comparison
- All models support binary (focused/distracted) and multi-class outputs
- Modular design allows easy model swapping and experimentation
- Trained and evaluated on both real and synthetic EEG data

Slide 6: System Pipeline
- Data loading from various sources and formats
- Preprocessing: filtering, segmentation, feature extraction
- Model inference: predicts attention state from features
- Real-time visualization: attention trends, brainwave activity
- Feedback loop for user or system adaptation
- Extensible for integration with external applications (e.g., alerts)

Slide 7: Results & Impact
- Accurate, real-time attention detection demonstrated in tests
- Robust to noise, artifacts, and varying data quality
- Enables adaptive learning, driver monitoring, and BCI demos
- User-friendly interface for visualization and feedback
- Open-source and customizable for research and development
- Potential to improve safety, engagement, and productivity

Slide 8: Future Work
- Add more data sources (wearables, mobile EEG, eye trackers)
- Enhance visualization (topographic brain maps, long-term trends)
- Improve model accuracy and generalization
- Deploy as a cross-platform, user-friendly application
- Integrate with external systems (education, automotive, healthcare)
- Conduct large-scale user studies and real-world validation
